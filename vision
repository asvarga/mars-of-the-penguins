Here’s a glimpse the kind of game I’m going for. These are just the ideas most pertinent to the “Goals” for the game.
```
- Goals
	- A scripting game where Computation, Data, Messages, Permission are all treated like normal in-game resources
	- Emergent gameplay: simple rules give rise to complex interactions/strategies
	- Should be playable without scripting
- Gameplay
	- 1 main character (P) controlled by the player
	- Takes place in a randomly-generated 2D grid
		- Mine for resources and build stuff
	- P can build bots
		- Each bot gets a limited amount of computation per frame
		- Each bot gets a limited amount of data
		- Bots' actions are made "simultaneously" every frame
	- There are also global limits on resources. Ex: exploration, energy, materials
	- Messages can be sent between agents that are nearby
		- Communication systems (wires/radios/stations) can be built but have limited range. 
		- No global "internet".
		- Bots can only be re-programmed via message passing
	- Incorporate a robust permission system
- Long Term Possibilities
	- Intelligent agents that use built-in AI at a cost lower than it would be for the player to script it. They have some autonomy so are harder to control.
	- Enemies
	- Agents/vehicles unrestrained to the 2D grid
- Technical
	- P has a dedicated thread separate from the bots
	- Global restraints limit the game's compute/memory
	- Godot can load code at run-time, which will be crucial for scripting
		- Limiting computation on these scripts is the fun part
	- An object-capability model will be used to controls agents' rights
```
